The Terra Nova uses quite a few files to describe the missions. The most 
interesting one are the map files. They contain the landscape with the 
evaluation data and the textures. They also contain information about the
trees and things like that. By now I only figured out format of the 
landscape. So changing the positions of the trees is not yet possible.
Every map file contains two landscapes: a high resolution one and one with
a low resolution. The high resolution one is an array of 513x513 points.
Every point describes a square of 6m x 6m. This is the map on which you 
actually play the game. The total area covert by this map is 3072m x 3072m
that's appoximatly nine square kilometers. This map can be edited with
TNEDIT. The low resolution map describes the surrounding area like the
mountains you see at the horizon. It is an array of 257x257 points, where
each point describes an area of 24m x 24m. The total map area which can be
displayed in Terra Nova covers nearly 38 square kilometers. 
Every point in the maps has information about its height above ground and
lies in the range from -2048 to 2047. It also contains information whether
there is a "shadow" from a hill or things like that. Shadows can be entered
in the range from 1 to 4, where 1 is the full sun light and 4 is quite dark.
Every point has a texture. The texture is 64x64 pixels big and there are
about 64 textures per planet. On some planets there are more on some planets
there are less textures. Every texture can be turned in steps of 90 degrees.
I called this "bearing" in my editor. 
Right now there is only one way to edit the low resolution map: You can use
the "PCX2RES" tool to convert a 1025x1025 pixel greyscaled PCX-image to the
height field of a map. This will generate the low and the high resolution map.
But the low resolution map cannot be modified with TNEDIT right now. The only 
way to view it is to select topview (STRG+V) in TNEDIT and view it (STRG+I).

There is a tool called "RES2RES": This copies the map of a RES-file into
another RES-file. That is usefule because you can keep the information about
the trees and exchange only the maps.

This is roughly my knowledgement about the Terra Nova Missions. If you want
to have more features, edit more things or want to help developping TNEDIT
just email me. I really would like to hear about your experiences with TNEDIT!

<Sorry. End of description right now. Don't have the time to do any more...>

So have fun, relax and send me your levels!
