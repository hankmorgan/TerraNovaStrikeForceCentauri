Operation "Stone Henge" is a completly new level for the 1st demo of "Terra Nova
- Strike Force Centauri" a brilliant game by Looking Glass (www.lglass.com).

It was designed with "TNEdit V0.64a" and "EdMis V0.1". It's landscape is based
on "MAP2.RES" of the full version of Terra Nova. It features a new debriefing,
new weaponry for the pirates and the captains, new objects (already in the game,
but never used there) and a lot of fun. This level isn't intendet for beginners!
It's for people who know how to operate a PBA under battle conditions. It is not
extremly easy to archive the mission goal, but if you're trained well, you can
make it in under 10 minutes (please send me a screenshot, if you do so!).

Three remarks for the gameplay:
  
     1) Use your drones to check where the enemies are - the favourite way to
        die is to be rushed from the side by an unseen pirate!

     2) Think strategically! This is Terra Nova you're playing, not DOOM!

     3) Don't shoot at the SFC Troops stationed at the spaceport!
     

If you like, feel free to send me an email and check my web site next week for 
new releases!

Have a lot of fun,
