**This program was developed with DJGPP v2.10 (www.delorie.org)**

WARRANTY: This is no commerical software! It was just made for fun.
So the use of this software is at your own risk! 


A complete manual will (hopefully) follow in the near future. By now,
relax, read the online help (STRG+H) and... relax!
It may help if you read the old description about the Terra Nova maps,
available on my homepage too.
Nevertheless you should read the file "advanced.txt" which describes a part
of the Terra Nova map format. It is very useful to understand what you can
do with TNEDIT and its tools!


Files in this distribution:

advanced.txt   Description of a part of the TN-map format
cwsdmpi.exe    DPMI-server (from DJGPP)
font.pcx       Font for TNEDIT
missions.txt   Description of the missions
page1.pcx      Help: page 1
page2.pcx      Help: page 2
pcx2res.exe    Read advanced.txt!
plnt0.pal      Palette for planet 0/0s
plnt1.pal      Palette for planet 1
plnt2.pal      Palette for planet 2
plnt3.pal      Palette for planet 3
plnt4.pal      Palette for planet 4
readme.txt     This file!
res2res.exe    Read advanced.txt!
tnedit.exe     The editor itself


What else you need to run:

Copy from your original Terra Nova-CD

   1)  \data\resplnt*.res (required)
   2)  \maps\map*.res (optional, but at least one!)

into that directory that contains TNEDIT.

You may want to get my examples package. It's available on my homepage, too.

Calling TNEDIT without any parameters will view a short description of the
commandline parameters. Just take a look.

Select a mission of your choice. Look at "missions.txt" to find out
which planet it uses and call tnedit!

To play your modified maps just copy the map into the \maps\-folder on your
harddisk and overwrite the old map. There are other ways to do that, but I
suggest to read the old description of the missions on my homepage. There is
a detailled description of the possibilities and things to do to play your
missions.
                                     
Have fun, relax and send me your levels!
