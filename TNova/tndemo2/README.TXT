Welcome to the Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri Demo                     
***********************************************************

This demo contains three heart-pounding missions that
are not in the shipping game. These are missions designed
specifically for this demo!

Terra Nova has some known problems running under 
Win95. If you experience any, please boot under DOS and
try again.

USEFUL TIPS

- Right clicking on an object will acquire a target lock on
  it.

- Pressing 'H' will bring up the help screen.

- Pressing 'O' will bring up the options panel. You can
  change the resolution to 320x400 or change detail 
  settings.

- Pressing 'G' or clicking in the upper left red box will
  toggle between full-screen and half-screen modes.

- Pressing the Space Bar will activate your jump-jets. 
  Watch your jump-jet fuel level in the upper right.  

- The Multipulsar has the longest weapon range.

- The Grenade launcher does plenty of damage, but watch
  the ammo count.

- The Laser is a continuous-fire weapon, and has the 
  lowest travel time to your target.

- Smoke grenades provides cover. Beam weapons do not
  pass through smoke.

- After your mission objectives are achieved, the 
  dropship will come to the pickup point.

- After the dropship has landed at the pickup point, press
  return when you want to have the dropship pick you up.

- If you need to abort the mission, press CTRL-ESC.

- Friendly tip: Don't shoot the dropship; it won't be happy
  with you.

- If you take enough damage, your video system will glitch 
  (screen flicker/static/pop).

- If you get too close to the edge of the map, your mission
  will end.  Your dropship pilot will warn you if you're
  getting too far off of the mission area.
